This file contains details regarding logic for The Wind Waker Randomizer dv_im.

### General Logic Types

There are now a few knew logic types to choose from instead of a singular one with TWWR.

**Glitchless** - This has no expectation of any tricks or glitches to complete the seed. Performing tricks or glitches will create out of logic or sequence break segments.
*Standard*
Every seed, up to 1.8.0c, was Glitchless – Standard logic.
No changes, compared to 1.8.0c, were implemented.
*Beginner*
This has the expectation of a new player to the randomizer.
Certain actions may not be reasonable to a new player, or one coming from vanilla, as they are not expected or possible in the base game.
Changes from *Glitchless – Standard* are as follows:
- Outset Great Fairy check requires the player be able to have magic after landing
- Jabun's Cave requires bombs, in addition to either Nayru's Pearl or both Din's and Farore's Pearl
- Savage Labyrinth requires having at least one empty bottle
- All House of Wealth checks require having a progressive wallet (with the exception of the 5 rupee auction)
- Pirate Ship expects you to have the Deku Leaf
- All trading quest checks require a progressive wallet
- Battlesquid/Sploosh Kaboom second and record victories require progressive wallet
- Barrel Shooting second victory require progressive wallet
- Dragon Roost Island's boulder chest only requires bait bag or Hero's Bow
- Forest Haven's Southern Isle check requires player to be able to have magic after landing
- All mail checks hard require Song of Passing
- Salvage Corps requires Grappling Hook
- Ghost Ship requires player to be able to defeat all possible enemies
- Fire Mountain and Ice Ring Isle secret caves require player to defeat Keese
- Cabana Maze checks require player to be able to defeat ReDeads
- Boating Course raft requires bombs
- Overlook secret Cave requires player to be able to defeat all possible enemies
- Pawprint Wizzrobe cave requires player to be able to defeat all possible enemies
- Most combat lookout platforms require either Skull Hammer or any sword
- Ankle's Tingle Statue reward requires progressive wallet
- Horseshoe hard requires Hookshot
- Dungeons expect completion in generally vanilla order
  - Dragon Roost Cavern does not expect the player to glide below to the Boss Key chest
  - Forbidden Woods expects player to have a small key to complete basement and boss room branch
  - Tower of the Gods requires player to be able to defeat Yellow ChuChus
  - Helmaroc King hard requires either Deku Leaf or Hookshot
  - Earth Temple requires player to be able to defeat all kinds of ChuChus
  - Wind Temple requires player to be able to replenish their magic if they need to use the Deku Leaf

**Glitched** - This has the expectation that the player is capable of certain tricks or glitches in the spirit of the randomizer. Performing tricks or glitches may be considered in logic but is not always absolutely necessary.
*Trivial*
Trivial tricks or glitches are ones that generally require little to no practice to perform or are easily retriable.
Generally speaking, this is intended for a seasoned player of TWWR looking to increase the difficulty without going into extremely difficult territory.
Changes from *Glitchless – Standard* are as follows:
- Needle Rock flaming chest can require Fire Arrows
- Diamond Steppe secret cave entrance can require a timed void-out and Wind Waker dive instead of Hookshot
- Cliff Plateau highest isle check can require chest storage instead of Deku Leaf (gotten inside secret cave)
- Bird's Peak secret cave entrance can require chest storage or Grappling Hook instead of Bait Bag (gotten at Cliff Plateau highest isle)
- Islet of Steel interior no longer requires Bombs
- Southern Great Fairy can require dry storage instead of Bombs or Fire Arrows (gotten at Angular Isle)
- Pawprint Isle ChuChu cave left boulder chest no longer requires Bombs or Power Bracelets
- Pawprint Isle ChuChu cave right boulder chest can require Deku Leaf instead of Bombs or Power Bracelets
- Pawprint Isle weird tree secret cave entrance can require a bomb boost and Deku leaf instead of Hookshot
- Dragon Roost Island boulder chest can require Deku Leaf and either any sword or Skull Hammer instead of Bombs, Bow, Boomerang or Bait Bag
- Private Oasis secret cave entrance can require chest storage and either Deku Leaf or Hookshot instead of Delivery Bag and Cabana Deed (gotten at Private Oasis water fall chest)
- Rock Spire secret cave entrance can require a leaf pump instead of Bombs
- Forest Haven dungeon entrance can require cyclone deploy
- Gale Isle dungeon entrance can require Wind Waker buffer
- Forbidden Woods tall room chest before miniboss no longer requires defeating Peathats
- Kalle Demos can be defeated with Bombs or Hero's Bow instead of Boomerang
- Tower of the Gods first floor skip can now be in logic for both second floor onward and behind the boat room boulders
- Tower of the Gods beyond last Goddess Idol can require Bombs instead of Deku Leaf
- Forsaken Fortress can be entered without Bombs
- Earth Temple no longer requires defeating Red Bubbles
- Puppet Ganon does not require Boomerang
- Ganondorf does not require Grappling Hook
*Moderate*
Moderate tricks or glitches are ones that require more deliberate effort and practice to perform.
Generally speaking, this is intended for players with experience with speedrunning strategies of TWW for GameCube.
Changes from *Glitched – Trivial* are as follows:
- Ghost Ship can require leaf pumping instead of defeating enemies
- Cabana maze checks can require sidle clipping and/or OOB weird-shots instead of Skull Hammer
- Dragon Roost Island long passage check can require dry storage instead of Deku Leaf and either any sword, Skull Hammer, or Boomerang (gotten at Dragon Roost Island boulder chest)
- Dragon Roost Cavern can require shooting down the platform to access last leg of the dungeon (up to the jar room and miniboss)
- Tower of the Gods behind boulder chest can require a roll clip instead of Bombs
- Tower of the Gods behind Skulls chest can require a OOB leaf pump instead of Hero's Bow
- Tower of the Gods boss key chest can require Bombs instead of other items
- Earth Temple can require a leaf pump to skip the first required use of Command Melody
- Earth Temple boss key chest can require a roll clip instead of completing the maze puzzle
*No Logic*
As the name suggest, the randomizer operates with as little logic as possible.
Soft and hard locks are very likely.
The only logic in place is:
- Bosses require all dungeon-specific keys and boss key
- Sunken Treasures require correct numbered charts in randomized charts
- Ganondorf requires all regularly required items

### Custom Logic Injection

This folder will house custom logic injection file. If injection files meet certain checksums and structure, upon launching the randomizer, they will be selectable from the logic type dropdown.
Custom logic and injection files are not directly associated with The Wind Waker Randomizer, dv_im, or any directly related party of either repository.
As of 1.8.0d, dv_im does not yet support custom logic injection.

**Structure** - This is subject to change prior to the release of custom logic injection
*<inject Creator='str', Type='str', Change='int', File='str', Checksum='float'>*
1. Creator -  Dictates the creator of the custom logic
2. Type -     Dictates the name of the custom logic
3. Change -   Dictates the total number of checks changed
4. File -     Dictates the file name of the injection
5. Checksum - ????? We'll get there when we get there

*<check Name='str', Mode='char', Needs='list', Types='list'>*
1. Name -     Dictates the name of the check as dictated by TWWR
2. Mode -     Dictates the injection method
              - 'o' is to overwrite or replace current existing data
              - 'a' is to append or add to current data
3. Needs -    Dictates required items to complete check
              - '&' is used to dictate a requirement of multiple items (AND)
              - '|' is used to dictate a requirement of variable items (OR)
              - '(' and ')' is used to dictate complex relations
              - '&' and '|' cannot be on the same nesting level
4. Types -    Dictates the settings users must enable to make check a valid location (Comma separated formatting)
