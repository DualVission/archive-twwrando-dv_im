This file contains details regarding logic for The Wind Waker Randomizer dv_im.

### General Logic Types

There are now a few knew logic types to choose from instead of a singular one with TWWR.

**Glitchless** - This has no expectation of any tricks or glitches to complete the seed. Performing tricks or glitches will create out of logic or sequence break segments.
*Standard*
Every seed, up to 1.8.0c, was Glitchless – Standard logic.
Changes from *Glitchless – Standard* 1.8.0f are as follows:

*Beginner*
This has the expectation of a new player to the randomizer.

  - Helmaroc King hard requires either Deku Leaf or Hookshot
  - Earth Temple requires player to be able to defeat all kinds of ChuChus
  - Wind Temple requires player to be able to replenish their magic if they need to use the Deku Leaf

**Glitched** - This has the expectation that the player is capable of certain tricks or glitches in the spirit of the randomizer. Performing tricks or glitches may be considered in logic but is not always absolutely necessary.
*Trivial*
Trivial tricks or glitches are ones that generally require little to no practice to perform or are easily retriable.
Generally speaking, this is intended for a seasoned player of TWWR looking to increase the difficulty without going into extremely difficult territory.
Changes from *Glitchless – Standard* are as follows:
- Windfall Lenzo's second level left and right chest can require text storage and door cancel instead of Pictobox.

- Earth Temple no longer requires defeating Red Bubbles
- Wind Temple final Wind God's Stone skip can be required

Moderate tricks or glitches are ones that require more deliberate effort and practice to perform.

- Superswims may be required
- Outset Great Fairy can require Bait Bag, Hero's Bow, and Wind Waker or Deku Leaf and Wind Waker instead of Deku Leaf and Power Bracelets

*No Logic*
As the name suggest, the randomizer operates with as little logic as possible.
Soft and hard locks are very likely.
The only logic in place is:
- Ganondorf requires all items necessary for *Glitched – Lunatic*

### Custom Logic Injection

This folder will house custom logic injection file. If injection files meet certain checksums and structure, upon launching the randomizer, they will be selectable from the logic type dropdown.
Custom logic and injection files are not directly associated with The Wind Waker Randomizer, dv_im, or any directly related party of either repository.
**Important Notes**
*Checksum can be calculated as follows:*
- e = (a^(b+c))%d
- a is the length of Creator
- b is the number of Change(s) defined modulated by 2
- c is the length of File as defined above modulated by 6 plus 1
- d is the length of Description
- e is the Checksum
*XML - .dv_im*
- Tags must end with a forwardslash "/", otherwise errors may be raised.
- Except <inject>, which needs to wrap all other tags. See example.dv_im for more information
- White space outside variables is for legibility
*YAML - .yaml*
- Capitalization and white space are extremely important

**Structure** - This is subject to change prior to the release of custom logic injection
*XML - .dv_im*
 *<inject Creator="str" Type="str" Description="str" Change="int" File="str" Checksum="int">*
